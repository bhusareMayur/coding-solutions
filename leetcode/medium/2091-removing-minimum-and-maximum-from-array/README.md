# Removing Minimum and Maximum From Array

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given a  **0-indexed**  array of  **distinct**  integers `nums`.

There is an element in `nums` that has the  **lowest**  value and an element that has the  **highest**  value. We call them the  **minimum**  and  **maximum**  respectively. Your goal is to remove  **both**  these elements from the array.

A  **deletion**  is defined as either removing an element from the  **front**  of the array or removing an element from the  **back**  of the array.

Return  *the  **minimum**  number of deletions it would take to remove  **both**  the minimum and maximum element from the array.* 

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [2,10,7,5,4,1,8,6]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The minimum element in the array is nums[5], which is 1.
The maximum element in the array is nums[1], which is 10.
We can remove both the minimum and maximum by removing 2 elements from the front and 3 elements from the back.
This results in 2 + 3 = 5 deletions, which is the minimum number possible.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [0,-4,19,1,8,-2,-3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The minimum element in the array is nums[1], which is -4.
The maximum element in the array is nums[2], which is 19.
We can remove both the minimum and maximum by removing 3 elements from the front.
This results in only 3 deletions, which is the minimum number possible.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: nums = [101]
Output: 1
Explanation:  
There is only one element in the array, which makes it both the minimum and maximum element.
We can remove it with 1 deletion.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- -105 <= nums[i] <= 105
- The integers in nums are distinct.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumDeletions(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length == 1) return 1;
        int n = nums.length;
        int mini = 0;
        int maxi = 0;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < n;i++){
            if(nums[mini] > nums[i]) mini  = i;
            if(nums[maxi] < nums[i]) maxi = i; 
        }
        // System.out.println("maxi :"+maxi);
        // System.out.println("mini :"+mini);

        int w1 = maxi > mini ? maxi + 1 : mini + 1;
        int w2 = maxi < mini ? n - maxi : n- mini;
        int w3 = maxi < mini ? (maxi + 1 + (n - mini)) : (mini + 1 + (n - maxi));
        //  System.out.println("w1 :"+w1);
        //  System.out.println("w2 :"+w2);
        //  System.out.println("w3 :"+w3);
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        if(ans > w1) ans = w1;
        if(ans > w2) ans = w2;
        if(ans > w3) ans = w3;



        return ans;

    }
}
```
